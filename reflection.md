# GitHub Fundamentals Reflection

## What I Learned

Given my prior experience with GitHub, I was already familiar with many of the concepts covered in this module. However, I did learn a few new things such as the importance of writing good commit messages and the best practices for using branches effectively.

## What I'm Still Confused About

Nothing at the moment. I have been using GitHub for a while, so the concepts covered were mostly familiar to me.

## About Me
My profile already includes an updated READEME file containing information about my projects and skills.
